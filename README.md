# Local-LLM

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Josh-XT/Local-LLM)

Local-LLM is a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server in Docker with OpenAI Style Endpoints that allows you to start it with the URL of the model from Hugging Face. It will automatically download the model from Hugging Face and configure the server for you. It also allows you to automatically configure the server based on your CPU, RAM, and GPU. It is designed to be as easy as possible to get started with local models.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) (if using NVIDIA GPU)

If using Windows and trying to run locally, it is unsupported, but you will need [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) at a minimum in addition to the above.

## Find a Model

The first thing you will need to do is find a model you want to use.

[Browse models on Hugging Face for GGUF format by clicking here. TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke?search_models=GGUF) generally sticks to the same naming convention for his models, so you can just use the model repository name like `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF` and it will automatically download the model from Hugging Face. If the model repositories are not in the format he uses, you can use the full URL to the model of the download link like `https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF/resolve/main/mistral.7b.q5_k_s.gguf` and it will download the quantized model from Hugging Face.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/Local-LLM
cd Local-LLM
```

## Environment Set Up

There are two options, you can either manually set up your environment variables or you can use the automated script to set up your environment variables based on your CPU, RAM, and GPU.

### Automated Environment Set Up

The automated script uses `gpt4free` as a free OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` model only to ask it what settings are recommended for your system. It will then set up your `.env` file with the recommended settings. If you run this, you can skip the manual environment set up section. You can also set the `--api_key` argument to set the API key for the server.

```bash
python3 configure.py --model_url "TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF" --api_key ""
```

### Manual Environment Set Up

Create a `.env` file if one does not exist and modify it to your needs. Here is an example `.env` file:

```env
MODEL_URL=TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF
QUANT_TYPE=Q4_K_M
MAX_TOKENS=8192
THREADS=10
THREADS_BATCH=10
GPU_LAYERS=0
MAIN_GPU=0
BATCH_SIZE=512
LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY=
```

- `LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY` - The API key to use for the server. If not set, the server will not require an API key.
- `MODEL_URL` - The model URL or repository name to download from Hugging Face. Default is `TheBloke/Mistral-7B-OpenOrca-GGUF`.
- `QUANT_TYPE` - The quantization type to use. Default is `Q4_K_M`.
- `MAX_TOKENS` - The maximum number of tokens. Default is `8192`.
- `THREADS` - The number of threads to use.
- `THREADS_BATCH` - The number of threads to use for batch generation, this will enable parallel generation of batches. Setting it to the same value as threads will disable batch generation.
- `BATCH_SIZE` - The batch size to use for batch generation. Default is `512`.
- `GPU_LAYERS` - The number of layers to use on the GPU. Default is `0`.
- `MAIN_GPU` - The GPU to use for the main model. Default is `0`.

## CPU Only

Run with docker:

```bash
docker pull joshxt/local-llm:cpu
docker run -d --name local-llm -p 8091:8091 joshxt/local-llm:cpu --env-file .env
```

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```

## NVIDIA GPU

If you're using an NVIDIA GPU, you can use the CUDA version of the server.

Run with docker:

```bash
docker pull joshxt/local-llm:cuda
docker run -d --name local-llm -p 8091:8091 --gpus all joshxt/local-llm:cuda --env-file .env
```

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cuda.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cuda.yml up
```

## OpenAI Style Endpoint Usage

OpenAI Style endpoints available at `http://localhost:8091/` by default. Documentation can be accessed at that url when the server is running.

**Note, you do not need an OpenAI API Key, this is your own API Key for the server if you defined one.**

### Completion

```python
import openai

openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8091/v1"
openai.api_key = "YOUR API KEY IF YOU SET ONE IN THE .env FILE"
prompt = "Tell me something funny about llamas."

response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="Local-LLM",
    prompt=prompt,
    temperature=1.31,
    max_tokens=8192,
    top_p=1.0,
    frequency_penalty=0,
    presence_penalty=0,
    stream=False,
)
message = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(message)
```

### Chat Completion

```python
import openai

openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8091/v1"
openai.api_key = "YOUR API KEY IF YOU SET ONE IN THE .env FILE"
prompt = "Tell me something funny about llamas."
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="Local-LLM",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=1.31,
    max_tokens=8192,
    top_p=1.0,
    n=1,
    stream=False,
)
message = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
print(message)
```

### Embeddings

The embeddings endpoint is uses an ONNX embedder with 256 max tokens.

```python
import openai

openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8091/v1"
openai.api_key = "YOUR API KEY IF YOU SET ONE IN THE .env FILE"
prompt = "Tell me something funny about llamas."

response = openai.Embedding.create(
    input=prompt,
    engine="Local-LLM",
)
embedding = response.embedding
print(embedding)
```
