Local-LLM is a simple [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server in Docker with OpenAI Style Endpoints that allows you to send the model name as the name of the model as it appears in the model list, for example `phi-2-dpo`. It will automatically download the model from Hugging Face if it isn't already downloaded and configure the server for you. It automatically configures the server based on your CPU, RAM, and GPU. It is designed to be as easy as possible to get started with running local models.

- [PowerShell 7.X](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (Windows or Mac)

### Linux Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Josh-XT/Local-LLM
cd Local-LLM
```

Make your modifications to the `.env` file or proceed to accept defaults running on CPU without an API key.

<details>
  <summary>Environment Setup (Optional)</summary>

None of the values need modified in order to run the server. If you are using an NVIDIA GPU, I would recommend setting the `GPU_LAYERS` and `MAIN_GPU` environment variables. If you plan to expose the server to the internet, I would recommend setting the `LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY` environment variable for security. `THREADS` is set to your CPU thread count minus 2 by default, if this causes significant performance issues, consider setting the `THREADS` environment variable manually to a lower number.

Modify the `.env` file to your desired settings. Assumptions will be made on all of these values if you choose to accept the defaults.

Replace the environment variables with your desired settings. Assumptions will be made on all of these values if you choose to accept the defaults.

- `LOCAL_LLM_API_KEY` - The API key to use for the server. If not set, the server will not require an API key when accepting requests.
- `THREADS` - The number of CPU threads Local-LLM is allowed to use. Default is `your CPU thread count minus 2`.
- `GPU_LAYERS` (Only applicable to NVIDIA GPU) - The number of layers to use on the GPU. Default is `0`.
- `MAIN_GPU` (Only applicable to NVIDIA GPU) - The GPU to use for the main model. Default is `0`.

## Usage

```bash
./start.ps1
```

## OpenAI Style Endpoint Usage

OpenAI Style endpoints available at `http://<YOUR LOCAL IP ADDRESS>:8091/v1` by default. Documentation can be accessed at that <http://localhost:8091> when the server is running. There are examples for each of the endpoints in the [Examples Jupyter Notebook](tests/tests.ipynb).
